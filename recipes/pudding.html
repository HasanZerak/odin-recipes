        <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>3 eggs </li>

        <li>½ cup butter, melted </li>
        <li>1 (2.45 ounce) package sliced almonds </li>

        <li>½ teaspoon orange-vanilla flavoring (such as Fiori di Sicilia® (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps.</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gently heat buttermilk and figs in a saucepan over medium-low heat until softened, 10 to 15 minutes; set aside until cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a tube pan.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer on high for 1 minute. Add fig-and-buttermilk mixture, bread crumbs, butter, almonds, orange marmalade, orange zest, and orange-vanilla flavoring to the beaten eggs; beat on low speed until blended. Gradually add flour mixture while beating until just incorporated into a batter. Spoon batter into prepared pan. Grease a sheet of aluminum foil; use to cover pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until firm and pulling away from sides of the pan, about 2 hours. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan.</li>
    </ol>
